**General Information & Guidelines for Pilgrims:**

*   **Temple Etiquette & Rituals (Local Customs):**
    *   **Dress Code:** Dress modestly. Shoulders, chest, and knees should be covered. Avoid shorts, short skirts, or revealing tops.
    *   **Footwear:** Always remove your shoes before entering the main temple complex. Designated shoe-keeping facilities are usually available.
    *   **Photography:** Photography is often prohibited inside the main sanctum (Garbhagriha). Look for signs or ask for permission.
    *   **Offerings ('Prasad'):** You can buy 'prasad' from official counters. It is offered to the deity and then received back as a blessing.
    *   **Respect:** Maintain a respectful and quiet demeanor inside the temple. Mobile phones should be switched off or on silent mode.

*   **Specific Temple Highlights:**
    *   **Somnath & Dwarkadhish:** Don't miss the spectacular evening 'Aarti' (light and sound ritual). It's a deeply spiritual experience.
    *   **Ambaji:** The temple is located on a hill. A ropeway (cable car) is available, which is a convenient option for elderly or physically challenged pilgrims.
    *   **Akshardham:** The Sahaj Anand Water Show is a major attraction, combining fountains, lights, and projections to tell a story from the Upanishads. Check the timings for it.

*   **General Travel Tips for Gujarat:**
    *   **Best Time to Visit:** October to March offers pleasant weather. Summers (April to June) can be very hot.
    *   **Transport:** Gujarat has a good network of state transport (GSRTC) buses. Auto-rickshaws and taxis are common for local travel.
    *   **Cuisine:** Be sure to try local Gujarati food like Dhokla, Fafda-Jalebi, and a traditional Gujarati Thali. Most temple towns offer pure vegetarian food.
    *   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water, especially during warmer months.
